/**
 * An experiment: one selection of problems, solved by every configuration it expands to, once per seed. Each
 * (problem, configuration, seed) is a case, and a case is one command the lab writes itself: a `klause-bench
 * solve-one` in the worktree of that configuration's commit.
 *
 * [problems] are bench selection filters (`suite`, `kind`, `per-family`, …), or a list of such selections whose
 * problems are pooled, each selection capped on its own. Each entry of [configs] is merged over
 * [base], and each result is crossed with every combination of [grid]'s values, so an A/B is a grid of one axis
 * with two values. A configuration's keys are bench solve arguments plus `ref` (the commit to build, default
 * `main`) and `label` (its name in results); `param.<name>` becomes `param=<name>=<value>`.
