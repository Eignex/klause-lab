/**
 * Keeps the lab on the newest klause-lab commit. At most every [intervalMs], or at once when [requestFile] exists (`lab
 * update` writes it), it fetches [source], the checkout the services were installed from, and finds whether its
 * upstream is ahead. An update never overlaps a job: the runner asks [due] between a job's cases and yields the job
 * when it is, then calls [maybeUpdate] with nothing running. That runs `deploy/update.sh`, which pulls, builds a new
 * release, checks the host and restarts both services onto it, this process included, so a return from
 * [maybeUpdate] after an update started means the update failed and the running release stays.
